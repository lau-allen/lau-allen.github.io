										<h2>About Me</h2>
									</header>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/healthdata.jpg" alt="" /></span>With a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University, I have had a not-so-standard start to my journey in pursing a career in Data Science. I was a typical Mechanical Engineering student, who enjoyed learning about mechanisms and had interests in designing machines like airplanes, wind turbines, and cars. However, I was most interested in working in healthcare engineering. This interest ultimately led me to having the opportunity to work at Epic Systems, an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) Software Company. During my tenure at Epic Systems, I collaborated with teams at three healthcare organizations, acting as a subject matter expert for Epic's Clinical Documentation Software, where my responsibilities included identifying and managing projects to ensure successful implementation and operationalization of the software. Eventually, I became involved in implementing predictive models that used patient data recorded in the EMR and flagged patients who are high-risk of dying or falling.  </p>
										<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/CCNY.jpg" alt="" /></span>In the past, I have heard of buzz words like “big data” and “artificial intelligence” and assumed it was just a media trend without much substance. My entire perception of these words changed after seeing how they can be used to impact important clinical and business decisions in healthcare and, most importantly, save lives. Drawing from my experiences, it is no surprise that I ultimately decided to pursue a Masters of Science in Data Science and Engineering at the City College of New York to obtain the knowledge and skills needed to develop these impactful models. Although there is still much to learn, I have now explored and applied statistical and machine learning techniques to a wide-breadth of different data sets as seen in this development portfolio. We live in a time where data is increasingly used to answer important questions and drive business decisions, and my goal is to contribute to this trend in areas like healthcare so that we become smarter and more efficient at solving everyday problems. </p>
